Description: stringr is a set of simple wrappers that make R's string
    functions more consistent, simpler and easier to use.  It does this
    by ensuring that: function and argument names (and positions) are
    consistent, all functions deal with NA's and zero length character
    appropriately, and the output data structures from each function
    matches the input data structures of other functions.
