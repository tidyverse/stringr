Description: stringr is a set of simple wrappers that make R's string 
  functions more consistent, simpler and easier to use.  It does this by 
  ensuring that: function and argument names (and positions) are consistent,
  all functions deal with NA's and zero length character appropriately, and 
  the output data structures from each function matches the input data 
  structures of other functions.
